ezpz post ignoring
=============
We all know the teamfortress.tv forums are filled with people who would seemingly rather be hated than post quality content. It is these people, then, that this project was designed for. Simply click the Ignore button beside any poster's name to hide their posts every time you visit a new page and save yourself the trouble of wasting precious seconds reading their awful wording.

Usage: Add the extension to chrome. The rest is self-explanatory.
